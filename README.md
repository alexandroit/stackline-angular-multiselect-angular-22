# @stackline/angular-multiselect-dropdown Angular 22 Playground

Lightweight StackBlitz playground for the Angular 22 line of `@stackline/angular-multiselect-dropdown`.

This playground installs `@stackline/angular-multiselect-dropdown@22.0.0` against Angular `22.0.0`.

This project includes the full live test matrix in one Angular app. Each example is isolated in its own folder, Angular module, route, and data object:

```text
src/app/examples/basic/basic.module.ts
src/app/examples/basic/basic.component.ts
src/app/examples/basic/basic.component.html
src/app/examples/basic/basic.component.scss
src/app/examples/basic/basic.data.ts
```

The same pattern is used for every route.

Shared layout follows the same maintainable Angular shape:

```text
src/app/app.component.ts
src/app/app.component.html
src/app/app.component.scss
src/app/shared/example-source.component.ts
src/app/shared/example-source.component.html
src/app/shared/example-source.component.scss
```

- settings-only skin switching
- classic, material, dark, custom, and brand skins
- accessibility-focused keyboard and ARIA contract checks
- `aria-selected` plus `aria-checked` multiselect state checks
- template slot examples for custom badges, labels, items, headers, and empty states
- renderless/headless state helper examples for custom Angular HTML
- dialog and overflow clipping support with `tagToBody`
- search, single selection, grouping, templating, limits, lazy loading, virtual scrolling, events, and disabled states
